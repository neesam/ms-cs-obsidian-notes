- ### Types of techniques
	- **Frequent Pattern Analysis**
		- Frequent itemset
			- e.g., purchases that occur together (milk, bread and eggs)
		- Frequent sequence
			- e.g., occurrences that happen in regular sequence (birds migrating)
		- Frequent structure
			- e.g., structures that occur regularly (p2p structures in social media)
		- Association rules
		- Correlation analysis
	- **Classification**
		- Pre-defined classes
		- Need training data
		- Build model to distinguish classes
	- **Prediction**
		- Numerical prediction (continuous value)
			- e.g., weather, stock price, and traffic volume
	- **Clustering**
		- No predefined classes
		- Intra-cluster similarity
		- Inter-cluster dissimilarity
	- **Anomaly Detection**
		- Anomaly/outlier
			- Differ from the "norm"
				- e.g., error, noise
				- e.g., fraud
				- e.g., extreme events
	- **Trend and Evolution Analysis**
		- Changes over time
			- Overall trend
			- Periodical patterns
			- Anomalies
