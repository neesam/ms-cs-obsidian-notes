- ### Numerical attributes: correlation coefficient
	- **Positive correlation**:
		- If one attribute has a high value, the other tends to have a high value
	- **No correlation**
	- **Negative correlation**:
		- If one attribute has a low value, the other tends to have a low value

- ### Nominal attributes: chi-square test
	- Comparing observed values of two attributes occurring together and expected value of two attributes occurring independently
