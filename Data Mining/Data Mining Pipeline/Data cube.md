- ### Overview
	- **Multi-dimensional data model**:
		- Dimensions:
			- Cube attribute
				- e.g., year, product, color
		- Facts:
			- Numeric measure
				- e.g., sales volume/value

- ### Operations
	- **Roll-up**:
		- Aggregation
			- e.g., daily -> monthly
	- **Drill-down**:
		- Reverse of roll-up
			- e.g., North America -> USA, Mexico, Canada, ...
	- **Pivot**:
		- Rotate (visualization)
			- e.g., <country, item> -> <item, country>
	- **Slicing**:
		- Select along a single dimension
			- e.g., country = 'USA'
	- **Dicing**:
		- Select along multiple dimensions
			- e.g., country = 'USA' and year = '2017'


- ### Materialization
	- **Full materialization**:
		- Pre-compute all cuboids and cells
			- Takes a lot of computing/time
				- May not need everything
	- **No materialization**:
		- No precomputation, on-demand
			- No waste of compute/time
			- Leads to latency in terms of user requests
	- **Partial materialization**:
		- Heuristically pre-compute some cuboids and cells
	- **Iceberg cube**
		- Only compute cuboid cells that are above a certain threshold
