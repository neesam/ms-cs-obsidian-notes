- ### Overview
	- A subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant, and nonvolatile collection of data in support of management's decision-making process

- ### Key characteristics
	- **Subject-oriented**
		- e.g., stores, customers, products, students, courses
		- Focuses on specific subjects, ignore unrelated ones
	- **Integrated**
		- e.g., new store location: customers, businesses, traffic
		- Heterogenous sources, data cleaning and integration
	- **Time-variant**
		- e.g., traffic information in the past 5-10 years
		- Historical data, longer time span, timestamped data
	- **Nonvolatile**
		- Typical data operations: initial loading, append, read
		- Separate from operational data, not updated in place

- ### Model
	- **Fact** (e.g., sales) vs. **dimension** (e.g., item, source, time-period)
	- **Star schema**:
		- One fact table, multiple dimension tables
	- **Snowflake schema**:
		- One fact table, multiple levels of dimension tables
	- **Fact constellation schema**:
		- Multiple fact tables, shared dimension tables
