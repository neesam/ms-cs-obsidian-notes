- ### Overview
	- A subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant, and nonvolatile collection of data in support of management's decision-making process
	- Supports analysis, reports, data mining

- ### Key characteristics
	- **Subject-oriented**
		- e.g., stores, customers, products, students, courses
		- Focuses on specific subjects, ignore unrelated ones
	- **Integrated**
		- e.g., new store location: customers, businesses, traffic
		- Heterogenous sources, data cleaning and integration
	- **Time-variant**
		- e.g., traffic information in the past 5-10 years
		- Historical data, longer time span, timestamped data
	- **Nonvolatile**
		- Typical data operations: initial loading, append, read
		- Separate from operational data, not updated in place

- ### Model
	- **Fact** (e.g., sales) vs. **dimension** (e.g., item, source, time-period)
	- **Star schema**:
		- One fact table, multiple dimension tables
	- **Snowflake schema**:
		- One fact table, multiple levels of dimension tables
	- **Fact constellation schema**:
		- Multiple fact tables, shared dimension tables

- ### Architecture
	- **Data sources**:
		- Structured, semi-structured, or unstructured
			- Flat files: e.g., CSV
			- Operational systems
			- CRM (Customer Relationship Management)
			- ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)
	- **Staging (ETL)**:
		- Extract data from various sources
		- Transform data
		- Load data into the data warehouse
	- **Data warehouse**:
		- Raw data, metadata, summary data
	- **Data marts**:
		- Subsets with specific focuses
