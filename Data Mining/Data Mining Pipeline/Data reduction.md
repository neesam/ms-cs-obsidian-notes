- ### Overview
	- Large data takes a long time to mine
		- Reduce data to make it more efficient
			- **Should still find similar patterns in reduced dataset**
	- **Dimensionality reduction**:
		- reducing number of columns
	- **Numerosity reduction**:
		- reducing number of rows

- ### Attribute selection
	- Identify useful attributes in a large dataset
	- **Forward selection**:
		- Keep adding (most informative) attributes
	- **Backward elimination**:
		- Keep removing (least informative) attributes
	- **Feature engineering**:
		- Domain knowledge, decision tree induction, ...
