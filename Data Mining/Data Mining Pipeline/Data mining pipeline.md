- ### Steps
	1. Data understanding
		- What types of data do I have? What do they look like?
		- Statistics & visualization
		- Similarity vs. dissimilarity
		- General patterns vs. anomalies
	2. Data preprocessing
		- Potential issues with data
			- e.g., missing data, errors, inconsistency
		- Preparing data for the mining process
			- Data cleaning, integration, transformation, reduction
		- **No good data, no good data mining!** 
	3. Data warehousing
		- Data cube & OLAP
			- Multi-dimensional data management
		- Data warehouse architecture
	4. Data modeling
		- Frequent pattern analysis
		- Classification, prediction
		- Clustering
		- Anomaly detection
		- Trend and evolution analysis
	5. Pattern evaluation
		- Finding **interesting** patterns from data
			- New, valid, generalizable, useful, explainable
		- Evaluation metrics
			- Accuracy, error rate
			- False positive/negative rate
			- Efficiency, latency, ...
		- Model selection
