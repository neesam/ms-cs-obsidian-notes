- #### Definition
	- Routing method where the same [[IP address|IP address]] is assigned to multiple servers or devices located in different geographical locations

- ##### How does it work?
	- Data is routed to the nearest or most optimal server, based on the network's routing protocols and conditions

- ##### Key benefits
	- ###### Reduced latency
		- Users are directed to the nearest server
	- ###### Load balancing
		- Traffic is distributed across multiple servers
	- ###### Improved redundancy
		- If one server fails, traffic is rerouted to another available server
