- ### Pod to pod
	- Each pod gets an IP address which is in a specific range defined by a subnet that is part of the overall k8s network
		- A way to handle communication efficiently within the cluster is needed since the k8s network may involve multiple nodes (which can be in different subnets)
			- **[[Container Network Interface (CNI)]]**
				- Defines rules for a [[Network plugin|network plugin]] (which sets up networking for a pod) to follow
				- Network plugin is called by container runtime
- ### Pod to pods
	- kube-proxy
		- Network component that runs on each [[Node|node]], maintaining network rules to handle traffic routing for [[Service|services]]
		- Forwards requests to appropriate pods, enabling service discovery and [[Load balancing|load balancing]]
		- Interfaces to [[iptables]] or [[ipvs]]

- ### Pod to external
	- Service type needs to be ExternalName in yaml file
	- When the connection is made, k8s translates the service name into the specified external IP or URL

- ### External to internal
	- Ingress controller
		- A load balancer, such as nginx, traefik, haproxy, etc.
		- Need to deploy ingress controller first
			- If using third-party provider, this is already done
	- Ingress
		- Created to tell the ingress controller how to reach a service
