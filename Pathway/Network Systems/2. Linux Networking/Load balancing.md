- ### Definition
	- A process by which traffic is directed to one of **n** servers that can handle a request
- ### Purpose
	- Used for scaling and resilience

- ### Considerations
	- **Server set**
		- Which servers are part of the set to choose from?
		- Servers are statically assigned
		- Heartbeat checks to see if servers are live and update table accordingly
	- **Flow affinity**
		- TCP is stateful, so we need to ensure all packets from the same TCP connection go to the same server

- ### Algorithms
	- **Source hashing**
		- Hash function determines server for source IP and port
			- Stateless; flow affinity is taken care of by the hash function
	- **Round robin**
		- Server selection iterates through each server in order
			- Ensures balanced load, assuming each request is roughly the same load
			- Load balancer needs to keep state for flow affinity
	- **Least connections**
		- Server selection is based on which has the least number of active connections
			- Takes into account that some requests may be longer, but assumes each connection imposes similar load on server
			- Load balancer needs to keep state
