- #### Definition
	- A formatted unit of data carried by a network. It consists of a [[Header|header]] and a payload. Packets are the fundamental unit of communication in most networks, particularly in IP-based networks

	- Used to break down large sets of data into smaller, manageable units for transmission across a network. This makes data transfer more efficient, as multiple packets can travel independently and take different paths to the destination
