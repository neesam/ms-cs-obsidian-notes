- ### Definition
	- **RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure)** is a security framework that uses digital certificates to verify the ownership of IP address blocks and Autonomous System (AS) numbers
- ### Purpose
	- It helps prevent route hijacking and misconfigurations by ensuring that only authorized organizations can announce specific IP address prefixes on the Internet.
- ### Architecture
	- Digital certificates are used to verify IP address block ownership and authorization for route announcements.
	- **Certificate Authorities (CAs)**, such as regional internet registries (RIRs), issue certificates to organizations for their IP resources.
	- Organizations create **ROAs (Route Origin Authorizations)** to specify which networks can announce their IP prefixes.
	- Validators check these ROAs to confirm that route announcements are legitimate, preventing route hijacking and misconfigurations.
