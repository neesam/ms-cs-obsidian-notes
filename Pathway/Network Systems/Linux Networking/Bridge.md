- ### Definition
	- A device that connects multiple networks or network segments into a single network

- ### How does it improve network performance?
	- Reducing traffic
		- Bridges only forward packets to the segments that need them, which can reduce unnecessary traffic and improve performance
	- Reducing collisions
		- By segmenting the network, a bridge reduces the collision domain, which leads to fewer collisions

- ### How are they different from [[Switch|switches]] or gateways?
	- Switch
		- Connect multiple devices on a LAN and enable communication between them
	- Gateway
		- Gateways translate between two different network protocols or architectures
