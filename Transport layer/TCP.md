- #### How does TCP allow for [[Reliable transfer|reliable transfer]]?
	- Datagram includes a sequence number
		- Indicates which bytes are contained in the datagram
		- Receiver can say which bytes in sequence it has received
	- Receiver sends an [[Datagram header|acknowledgement]] number to the sender

	- Sender performs [[Retransmission|retransmission]]
		- Sender can resend unacknowledged bytes in the stream
